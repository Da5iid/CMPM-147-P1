Title: "The AI Self-Checkout Experience."
 
This short remix of an "ad-lib" program that randomized the grammar words in a short script, story, etc.
In my remix, I have created a short satire story about the future of "Self-Checkout" booths at department stores. It takes place in a time where AI has become fully integrated within society. In the current year, that is in some ways already happening.
 
My simple added "complexity" part is a nested list of "name" prefixes and suffixes that are then pulled together randomly and used sometimes to create a unique first and last name for our AI friend. The complexity comes from nesting the "replacer" function into a two layer deep routine. While letting the work happen in the background, we only need to use the "$name" key in the script to create the full name.
 
One thing I wish I could have done to bring the code a level further was figuring out how to log what phrases and words the "replacer" function was picking. For example, when you scan your "item" I want to be able to use the name of that item more than once. With the way the example code is set up right now, there's not an easy way to save that information in a way I was able to find. Then again, that modification would probably be out of scope of this assignment.
 
Overall, I am very happy with the results of the story. It has the specific humor that I think my family would enjoy. Can it get deeper and more complex, Yes. Is it almost 2 AM? Yes.
